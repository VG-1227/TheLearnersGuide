TheLearnersGuide
Welcome to TheLearnersGuide-an innovative, privacy-first, multi-platform application designed to transform the way you learn new skills, with a special focus on programming and technical domains.

Project Goals
TheLearnersGuide aims to:

Personalize Learning:
Deliver tailored learning modules that adapt to each user's skill level, progress, and preferences using advanced NLP-powered insights.

Protect Privacy:
Ensure all computations and model inferences happen locally on the user's device-no data ever leaves your computer or phone.

Enable Skill Mastery:
Provide real-time feedback, code analysis, and actionable suggestions through an in-built compiler and fine-tuned GPT models.

Support All Platforms:
Offer a seamless, consistent experience across Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS using a Flutter-based interface.

Integrate Rich Content:
Curate and summarize the best documentation, online resources, and video tutorials, making quality learning material accessible and digestible.

Key Features
NLP-Based Personalization:
Dynamic adaptation of content and learning paths using local GPT models.

Local-First Design:
All user data and processing remain on-device for maximum privacy and independence from cloud services.

In-Built Compiler & Code Insights:
Real-time error detection, code quality analysis, and improvement tips for supported languages (Python, Java, C++, JavaScript).

Interactive Modules:
Quizzes, code challenges, and milestone achievements to keep learning engaging.

Progress Tracking:
Visual metrics and milestone-based achievements to motivate and guide users.

Technology Stack
Front-End: Flutter (Dart) for responsive, multi-platform UI.

Back-End: Python for logic, C++ for performance-critical components.

NLP: Hugging Face Transformers, lightweight GPT models fine-tuned for education.

Database: Local storage (e.g., SQLite) for user progress and settings.

Development Roadmap
Planning & Design:
Define supported skill domains, design UI/UX, and create personalization schema.

Core Development:
Build the Flutter front-end, Python back-end, and basic compiler integration.

NLP Integration:
Fine-tune and locally deploy GPT models for content summarization and code analysis.

Content Integration:
Summarize and format documentation and video content for interactive modules.

Testing & Optimization:
Ensure smooth performance and consistency across all supported platforms.

Launch:
Release beta, gather user feedback, and iterate for improvement.
